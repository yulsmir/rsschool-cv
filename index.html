            <h2>English</h2>
            <p>I studied English only at school and after that by myself just reading, writing and discussing topics I’m interested in. I’ve been in Business Development & Sales for 5+ years working for Ukrainian IT Outsourcing companies and finding interesting projects from all around the world. This experience is priceless and has it’s own benefits. My main activities were in English and included communication and negotiation with clients (verbal and written), preparing offers, contracts, writing guidelines and educating newcomers, managing sales department and teams. I have a lot of language practice, however, I’ve never passed any tests on checking the level of my English. I assume my current level is from upper-intermediate to advanced and it depends on topics.</p>
